        "Making student housing search at JOOUST simple, transparent, and stress-free"
      </p>
      <p class="mission-text">
        At JoouStay, we know how challenging it can be for JOOUST students to
        find a good place to stay. Between classes, tight budgets, and adjusting
        to campus life, housing shouldn’t be another burden. That’s why our
        platform focuses only on JOOUST, helping students find vacant houses
        close to campus and, if needed, match with roommates to make rent more
        affordable.
