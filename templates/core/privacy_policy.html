        <p>
          In our mission to make student housing better for everyone at JOOUST,
          we collect and use information about you, our
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>students using JoouStay</strong> to find housing and
            roommates

        </ul>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect,
          use, and share your personal information. If we change our privacy
          practices, we will post those changes on this page and update the
          revision date. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more
          prominent notice or get your consent as required by law.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="our-values">
        <h2>Our values</h2>
        <p>
          Trust is the foundation of the JoouStay platform and includes trusting
          us to do the right thing with your information. Three main values
          guide us as we develop our products and services. These values should
          help you better understand how we think about your information and
          privacy.
        </p>

        <h3>Your information belongs to you</h3>
        <p>
          We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our
          services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what
          we really need. Where possible, we delete or anonymize this
          information when we no longer need it. When building and improving our
          products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security
          teams to build in privacy by design.
        </p>

        <h3>We protect your information from others</h3>
        <p>
          If a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to
          share it unless you give us permission or we are legally required to
          do so. When we are legally required to share your personal
          information, we will tell you before we do so, unless we are legally
          forbidden.
        </p>

        <h3>We help students make informed decisions about their housing</h3>
        <p>
          We will never sell your personal information to anyone. We use your
          information to provide better housing recommendations and help you
          connect with suitable roommates, but we are thoughtful about how we do
          so.
